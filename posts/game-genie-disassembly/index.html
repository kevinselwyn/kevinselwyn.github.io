  <blockquote>NOTE: This was originally posted on a different blogging platform on April 8, 2016</blockquote>
<p>The original Game Genie is a cheat device for the Nintendo Entertainment System that alters game data in real-time. Users must &ldquo;program&rdquo; the Game Genie to perform certain actions. They do this by entering codes into the interface that appears before the game they wish to alter.</p>
<img src="/img/posts/game-genie-disassembly/interface.png" alt="Game Genie interface" style="margin-right:20px; float:left;" />
<p>Since the interface runs on the NES, it is also written in 6502 assembly, the programming language of the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>
<p>I undertook a disassembly of the Game Genie ROM to see just how the creators went about programming their infamous cheat device.</p>
<p>To see the full code explained here, check out the repo: <a href="https://github.com/kevinselwyn/game-genie-disassembly" target="_blank"><a href="https://github.com/kevinselwyn/game-genie-disassembly">https://github.com/kevinselwyn/game-genie-disassembly</a></a></p>
<p><img src="/img/posts/game-genie-disassembly/game-genie.gif" alt="Game Genie"></p>
<p>Note: My task wasn&rsquo;t so much to disassemble the ROM (that part is easy), as much as it was to put the parts of the disassembled ROM in context (that part is hard).</p>
<h2 id="the-basics-of-the-assembly">The Basics of the Assembly</h2>
<p>The ROM is made up of bytes of 6502 machine code that can also be represented in assembly language. Machine code like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>A9 01 8D 16 40 A9 00 8D 16 40 A0 08 AD 16 40 6A 26 07 88 D0 F7 A0 08 AD 17 40 6A 26 08 88 D0 F7 60
</code></pre><p>Can be written in assembly as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  LDA #$01
  STA $4016
  LDA #$00
  STA $4016
  LDY #$08
  LDA $4016
  ROR A
  ROL $07
  DEY
  BNE $F068
  LDY #$08
  LDA $4017
  ROR A
  ROL $08
  DEY
  BNE $F073
  RTS
</code></pre><p>33 bytes of machine code translate into 17 instructions of assembly code, the latter being easier on the eyes, more concise, and simpler to debug.</p>
<p>The result is a set of instructions that contain mnemonics for CPU instructions. LDA means to <b>L</b>oa<b>D</b> the <b>A</b>ccumulator register with whatever follows. Or <b>DE</b>creasing the <b>Y</b> register (DEY). Operands can be actual values, addresses in memory, the accumulator register itself, or have none at all (depending on the particular instruction).</p>
<p>Together, all these instructions make up the ROM and are what I will be poring over.</p>
<h2 id="the-anatomy-of-the-rom">The Anatomy of the ROM</h2>
<p>The Game Genie ROM is 24592 bytes and breaks down as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>| Name    | Size (bytes) |
|---------|--------------|
| Header  | 16           |
| PRG ROM | 4096 (x4)    |
| CHR ROM | 8192         |
</code></pre><p>The <b>Header</b> is 16 bytes of data that contains information useful to emulators, so will be (almost) ignored in the disassembly process.</p>
<p>The <b>PRG ROM</b> is the actual game code. On the Game Genie, the core code is repeated 4 times. So the total size is 16384 bytes, but we are only concerned with 1/4 of that.</p>
<p>The <b>CHR ROM</b> is the character data that contains graphics tiles that can be displayed in the background and in sprites.</p>
<h2 id="the-disassembly">The Disassembly</h2>
<p>The heavy lifter in the process of translating machine code into assembly code was <a href="https://github.com/mnaberez/py65" target="_blank">py65</a>, a 6502 simulator written in Python. It comes with a utility called <b>py65mon</b>, an interactive monitor that can be used to load a ROM and disassemble it.</p>
<p>First we load it in at offset 0xBFF0. The PRG ROM starts at offset 0x10, so we account for this by loading it in at 0xC000 - 0x10. The CHR ROM is cropped off as a result, but is unneeded at this point.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.load gamegenie.nes BFF0
?Wrote +16400 bytes from $bff0 to $ffff
       PC  AC XR YR SP NV-BDIZC

6502: 0000 00 00 00 ff 00110000
</code></pre><p>From there, it&rsquo;s easy as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>.disassemble F000:FFFF

$f000  78        SEI
$f001  d8        CLD
$f002  a9 00     LDA #$00
...
</code></pre><p>2157 lines later, and our disassembly is complete! Told you it would be easy.</p>
<h2 id="the-graphics">The Graphics</h2>
<p>The CHR ROM was recreated by looking at the PPU (Picture Processing Unit) data in an emulator. The graphics are extremely simple:</p>
<img src="/img/posts/game-genie-disassembly/chr.png" alt="Game Genie CHR" style="margin:0 auto; display:block;" />
<p>This image was converted back into CHR data using a utility I wrote: <a href="https://github.com/kevinselwyn/img2chr" target="_blank">img2chr</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-reassembly">The Reassembly</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m using a (slightly modified) version of <a href="https://github.com/kevinselwyn/nesasm" target="_blank">nesasm</a> to reassemble the ROM to see if we end up back at the same data as the source ROM.</p>
<p><i>nesasm</i> lets you include external source files or binary data, allowing developers to separate components of a project for greater abstraction and readability.</p>
<p>Here is our project structure:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>game-genie-disassembly/
  bank.asm       # Our program code to be duplicated 4 times
  constants.asm  # Unchanging registers, values, and offsets
  gamegenie.asm  # Main file
  gamegenie.png  # CHR data in PNG format
  variables.asm  # Variable aliases
</code></pre><p>Other files are included build build purposes, but these are the files we will break the ROM into for reassembly.</p>
<h2 id="the-breakdown">The Breakdown</h2>
<p>To make things easier to read/understand, I replaced all zero-page variables ($00-$FF) with variable names (variable_00-variable_FF). This will make it easier to swap out the ambiguous variable names later when I find out what they do or what data they hold.</p>
<p>Next, I chunked the code according to a few constraints. A new block was formed if:</p>
<ul>
<li>A RTS instruction is found (<b>R</b>e<b>T</b>urn From <b>S</b>ubroutine). That&rsquo;s a pretty clear indication that the code that came before was part of a subroutine</li>
<li>A JMP instruction is found (<b>J</b>u<b>MP</b> to address). The chunk doesn&rsquo;t necessarily come at the JMP, but rather, at the destination address.</li>
<li>Data is encountered. If instructions start to look weird, it&rsquo;s a pretty good chance we found a section of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a subroutine chunk:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$f01e a2 60 LDX #$60
$f020 a0 08 LDY #$08
$f022 ca DEX
$f023 d0 fd BNE $f022
$f025 88 DEY
$f026 d0 fa BNE $f022
$f028 60 RTS
</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s clean it up and add a label before offset $F022 for the BNE (<b>B</b>ranch on <b>N</b>ot <b>E</b>qual to zero) instructions:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  LDX #$60
  LDY #$08
label:
  DEX
  BNE label
  DEY
  BNE label
  RTS
</code></pre><p>Now, let&rsquo;s look at a data chunk:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$f83a 85 63 STA $63
$f83c a5 52 LDA $52
$f83e 85 62 STA $62
$f840 68 PLA
$f841 a8 TAY
$f842 60 RTS
$f843 19 19 19 ORA $1919,Y
$f846 19 1a 19 ORA $191a,Y
$f849 19 19 19 ORA $1919,Y
$f84c 1a ???
$f84d 19 19 19 ORA $1919,Y
$f850 19 1a 19 ORA $191a,Y
$f853 19 19 19 ORA $1919,Y
$f856 1a ???
</code></pre><p>Notice that for the first 6 lines, the instructions look normal. After that, things start to get weird. A lot of successive ORA (Logical <b>OR</b> with <b>A</b>ccumulator) instructions are not normal, and neither are the ??? instructions. Also, we can notice a sort of pattern in the 8 remaining (incorrectly disassembled) instructions. The instructions should look like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  STA &lt;variable_63
  LDA &lt;variable_52
  STA &lt;variable_62
  PLA
  TAY
  RTS
data:
  .db $19, $19, $19, $19
  .db $1A
  .db $19, $19, $19, $19
  .db $1A
  .db $19, $19, $19, $19
  .db $1A
  .db $19, $19, $19, $19
  .db $1A
</code></pre><h2 id="the-labeling">The Labeling</h2>
<p>A great starting point in creating labels that have some context is by looking at the vectors in the ROM.</p>
<p>3 16-bit vectors occur starting at offset $FFFA:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>| Vector | Offset |
|--------|--------|
| NMI    | $FFFA  |
| RESET  | $FFFC  |
| IRQ    | $FFFE  |
</code></pre><p>When the ROM boots, the CPU looks at these vectors (mainly the RESET vector) to tell it which address to jump to in the ROM at the start of execution.</p>
<p>The NMI vector is the address the CPU jumps to during every <b>N</b>on-<b>M</b>askable <b>I</b>nterrupt (usually run once every frame).</p>
<p>The IRQ vector is unused in this ROM. It is usually set to $0000 if unused, but is set to $FFFF in this case.</p>
<p>At the end of the Game Genie ROM, we have these disassembled instructions:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$fffa 7d f0 00 ADC $00f0,X
$fffd f0 ff BEQ $fffe
$ffff ff ???
</code></pre><p>If we weren&rsquo;t savvy to the vector locations to begin with, the strange &ldquo;instructions&rdquo; here would raise a red flag. Disassembled correctly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>NMI_vector:
  .db $7D, $F0

RESET_vector:
  .db $00, $F0

IRQ_vector:
  .db $FF, $FF
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that vectors (and many other 16-bit addresses are stored backwards. Meaning that the high byte appears second and the low byte first.</p>
<p>The RESET vector is actually $F000: the start of the last $1000-sized bank.</p>
<p><i>nesasm</i> can help us out with this by storing it as a word (16-bit value) with .dw instead of a byte (8-bit value) with .db:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>NMI_vector:
  .dw $F07D

RESET_vector:
  .dw $F000

IRQ_vector:
  .dw $FFFF
</code></pre><p>Much easier to read when following jumps in the source.</p>
<h2 id="the-variables">The Variables</h2>
<p>By default, all zero-page variables ($00-$FF) were named variable_00-variable_FF. The ones where I could derive context were changed. Note the following snippet:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$f08c ad 45 00 LDA $0045
$f08f 8d 05 20 STA $2005
$f092 ad 46 00 LDA $0046
$f095 8d 05 20 STA $2005
</code></pre><p>Based on what we know about $2005, the scroll register, it needs to be written to twice: once for the X scroll position and one more for the Y scroll position. It stands to reason that the variables right before each write to $2005 correspond to 2 variables that store those positions.</p>
<p>After rewriting:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  LDA scroll_x
  STA $2005
  LDA scroll_y
  STA $2005
</code></pre><h2 id="the-final-rom">The Final ROM</h2>
<p>This is the entirety <b>gamegenie.asm</b> the file that will compile into the final ROM:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>  .inesprg 1 ; 1 16KB PRG ROM
  .ineschr 1 ; 1 8KB CHR ROM
  .inesmir 1 ; Vertical Mirroring
  .inesmap 0 ; Mapper 0

  .bank 0
  .org $C000
  .incbin &#34;bank.raw&#34;
  .incbin &#34;bank.raw&#34;

  .bank 1
  .org $E000
  .incbin &#34;bank.raw&#34;
  .incbin &#34;bank.raw&#34;

  .bank 2
  .org $0000
  .incbin &#34;gamegenie.chr&#34;
</code></pre><p>The first 4 lines are iNES directives that set values in the header used for emulators:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>inesprg</b> - Sets the number of 16KB PRG ROMs. In this case, only 1.</li>
<li><b>ineschr</b> - Sets the number of 8KB CHR ROMs. Only 1 here as well.</li>
<li><b>inesmir</b> - Sets the nametable mirroring. Useful for scrolling, so relatively pointless here.</li>
<li><b>inesmap</b> - Sets the mapper number. 0 means no memory mapper is being used.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>bank.raw</b> is included 4 times because the main source is so small and must be repeated to fill out the 1 16KB PRG ROM space. Including the source 4 times creates duplicate label errors, so nesasm is used beforehand to compile just the 4KB bank once and then it is included 4 times in the final source code to compile the final ROM.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<blockquote><i>How much did you learn?</i></blockquote>
<p>Not much, really. I learned a lot about how to successfully disassemble a NES ROM, but precious little about what the code is actually doing. I managed to catch a glimmer of context at the beginning of the ROM (startup, config, etc.), but after that, it gets pretty esoteric.</p>
<blockquote><i>Why did you do this?</i></blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to disassemble a NES ROM. The file size is daunting, but the Game Genie ROM is small and on top of that, the main code is just repeated a few times to fill out the size. It was not very time intensive, so it&rsquo;s a good starting point for larger ROMs.</p>
<blockquote><i>What was the most interesting takeaway?</i></blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t realize until I was almost done that, essentially, the Game Genie was an unlicensed NES game; that is, a game not made with Nintendo&rsquo;s blessing. It&rsquo;s amazing to see snippets of code that I&rsquo;ve seen in other licensed NES games, as well as my own NES programming projects where the conventions were arrived at naturally.</p>
